PURE FUNCTIONS

Pure functions ensure that they not read or modify the state. Since add and getCompoundInterest does not require any state varible so we use pure in such functions

VIEW FUNCTIONS

These can only view the state varibles. So functions like ViewDues uses view function because we only have to view the loans mapping in the function
